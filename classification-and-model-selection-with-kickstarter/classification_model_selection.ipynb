For example: if a projects's goal is $\\$5000$ and it receives $\\$4999$ in funding, the project won't be a success.\n","\n","If you have a project that you would like to post on Kickstarter now, can you predict whether it will be successfully funded or not?

For instance, if your input data consists of strings that you wish to generate a word count feature from, you can just fill in the null values with empty strings (`\"\"`).\n","\n","Thankfully, `pandas` has a helpful function for dealing with null values: the `.fillna()` function.

However, there is *so* much more that we can do to extract useful information from our data. \n","\n","For instance, the `blurb` column contains unique strings and so, in its current form, isn't a particularly useful feature. Instead, we could create a new feature representing the length of the `blurb`, or the number of words in the `blurb`. \n","\n","Other string-type columns, such as `country`, contain categorical data. As there are a lot of countries represented, we might want to aggregate these into regions (e.g. `Europe`, `Asia`, ...). We can then convert this categorical data into a one-hot encoding using `sklearn`.\n","\n","What we are describing here is what's known as feature engineering and is an art and a science in its own right. \n","\n","Let's start this processing by importing some libraries and functions that can help us create features. Notice that we import the `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`. We can use this function on our numerical data to normalise it, which is an important step in training a machine learning model.\n","\n","**ðŸ’¡ In the following cell, you can use feature engineering to create features that you think might be useful.**\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","You may want to put all your processing within a function (such as `processing()`) or may want to do it just as plain Python code.
